# Vision-Transformer-for-CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
Objective Implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) for CIFAR-10 Image Classification. The goal is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using ViT and compare its performance with other models. This assignment will involve evaluating the effectiveness of the Transformer-based approach for image classification and comparing it with traditional and hybrid architectures. The following tasks are required the least:
• Preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset, ensuring that the images are properly normalized and prepared for training. Use standard data augmentation techniques like random cropping, flipping, and normalization to enhance dataset which may be useful for model performance.
• Implement the Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Ensure to divide the images into patches and apply positional encoding for input to the Transformer.
• Tune hyperparameters for ViT, such as the number of Transformer layers, number of heads in multi-head attention, learning rate, batch size, and patch size. Utilize techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize training.
• Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. Visualize the results of test images using confusion matrix.
• For comparision, implement a hybrid architecture where features from image patches are first learned using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and then fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) instead of using a Transformer.
• Implement a ResNet model for image classification on the same dataset. Instead of training a ResNet model from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset, utilize a pretrained ResNet and apply transfer learning technique. Use a ResNet model that was trained on a large-scale image dataset. Freeze the pretrained layers (feature extraction), and only train and fine-tune the additional classifier layers added to fine tune on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
• Compare the performance of the three models (ResNet, ViT, and the hybrid architecture) based on classification accuracy, training time, memory usage, and inference speed. You can also include additional metrics if you want (optional).
• Deploy the models on a local machine or cloud and visualize classification results for a set of test images. Include visualizations of correct and incorrect classifications.
• Plot training and validation accuracy and loss curves to illustrate the training process and observe if the models converge effectively.
• Present detailed results in a report, summarizing the methodology, findings, and challenges. Clearly explain the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture.
• Provide the code in a well-documented format, clearly explaining each step. Data Set CIFAR-10 Dataset
